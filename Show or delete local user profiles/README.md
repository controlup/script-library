# Name: Show or delete local user profiles

Description: Finds and optionally deletes local user profiles. The user can provide two arguments - the minimum profile age in days and the minimum profile size. The default operation mode is to display the profiles that fit these criteria. When the "Delete" option is set to "true", the script will delete the profiles it found.
