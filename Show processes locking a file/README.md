# Name: Show processes locking a file

Description: For any file on the target computer for which the user provides the full path, displays a list of processes with open handles to the file. This is useful for determining which process is locking the file, preventing its deletion or editing in another program.
The action makes use of Sysinternals handle.exe, which is downloaded, extracted into a temporary location and deleted after completion.
