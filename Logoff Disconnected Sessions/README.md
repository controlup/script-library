# Name: Logoff Disconnected Sessions

Description: As a CU Admin I want to be able to set up a trigger for disconnected sessions, and run an action to clean up any / all disconnected sessions for that user on all managed machines.
The same script should work equally-well as a right-click action from a session view..
