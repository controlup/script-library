# Name: Send Toast notification

Description: Displays a Toast notification on the users'desktop (Windows 10/Server 2016 or higher only). Designed to be used as an automated action with client metrics requiring ControlUp 8.5 or higher.
Take a copy of the script and either use as a regular SBA,  or set the defaults in the Param() block so it can be used in an automated action. If you  are using the standard parameters setting default values for these will also allow use in an automated action.
