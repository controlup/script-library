# Name: Show Local WMI Activity

Description: Enables the WMI-Activity trace event log for a given period of seconds and then processes any resulting events to show what processes are generating what WMI activity and how long they took.
The summary option will summarise by process and display ordered by the total duration taken by all WMI operations.
Without a summary, each individual WMI operation will be listed along with the actual WMI operation.
The trace event log will be disabled at the end of the trace.
