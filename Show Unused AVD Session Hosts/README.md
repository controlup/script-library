# Name: Show Unused AVD Session Hosts

Description: Use Azure Log Analytics data to find AVD Session Hosts which have not hosted any user sessions in the given timeframe. This can include both those powered up, which will likely incur more cost, as well as those not powered up.
Requires previously saved credentials for Azure for the user that runs the script - these can be stored using a ControlUp script.
