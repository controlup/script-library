# Name: Show Unsigned Service Binaries

Description: Query all services, both system and per-user, get the binary responsible for the service, which will be a dll when the service executable is svchost,exe and check its digital signature.
By default, only services whose binary is not validly signed will be shown but parameters are available to show any signing state and to show all services or just non-Microsoft ones
