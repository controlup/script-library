# Name: Horizon Recover Instant Clone

Description: This script Recovers a Horizon View Instant Clone through the VMware.Hv.Helper module. You can use this to 'rebuild' an Instant Clone if there is an issue with the machine. 
This action should be executed against a Horizon endpoint machine (one which has the HZ Primary Connection Server column populated in ControlUp Console). The script uses the target machine to determine the connection server address, and is executed on the machine running ControlUp Console.
