# Name: Get Ivanti Environment Manager Logon Time

Description: Displays how long Environment Manager held up the logon process. It will display the entire time as well as how long the Pre-Desktop trigger took to fire. This action requires the 9662 (Trigger Action Times) enabled in the EM policy for the "AppSense" event log. You may need to adjust the "Offset" at the beginning of the script according to your time zone.
