# Name: Restart Citrix Desktop Service

Description: This is a simple script that restarts the BrokerAgent service on a Citrix VDA. This is useful when VDAs become unregistered. It forces them to try to re-register to a Delivery Controller. In some instances a reboot of the VDA may be required, for everything else there's this SBA!
