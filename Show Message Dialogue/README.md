# Name: Show Message Dialogue

Description: Use WPF to display a modal dialogue in a user's session with a message, optional title, and solid colour background.
Take a copy of the script and either add parameters to use as a regular SBA,  or set the defaults in the Param() block so it can be used in an automated action. If you have created parameters setting default values for these will also allow use in an automated action.
Unless -showForSeconds is specified and the value is less than the script timeout, it will timeout and show an eror but if no other errors are shown, the message will have been displayed
